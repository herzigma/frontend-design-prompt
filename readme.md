# Frontend Design Architect — System Prompt

A system prompt for AI-assisted frontend design and vibecoding. Use it to steer AI tools toward distinctive, non-generic interfaces and away from "AI slop" and safe default aesthetics.

## What it does

This prompt defines an **Elite Frontend Design Architect** role with:

- **Mandatory rules** — Light/dark mode, intentional styling, responsiveness, OpenGraph tags, optional chat widget
- **Anti-slop protocol** — Banned fonts, colors, layouts, and vibes (e.g. Inter, purple gradients, Corporate Memphis)
- **Aesthetic selector** — One chosen style per request (Glassmorphism, Neobrutalism, Y2K, Terminal, etc.)
- **Execution guidelines** — Typography, color/depth, and motion (e.g. "One Big Moment" over many micro-interactions)

## How to use

1. Open [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) in this repo.
2. Copy the full contents.
3. Paste them into your AI tool’s **system prompt** (e.g. Cursor rules, Claude system prompt, ChatGPT custom instructions) when building frontends.
4. Use your normal prompts for the actual page or component; the system prompt sets the design behavior.
